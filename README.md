-- Interactive Quiz Application
The Interactive Quiz Application is a software system that allows users to create, take, and manage
quizzes composed of multiple-choice questions. The application supports user roles such as quiz
creators (e.g., instructors or admins) and quiz takers (e.g., students or general users). Users can design
quizzes by entering questions, answer options, and correct answers. Quiz takers can attempt quizzes
with real-time feedback, scoring, and a summary of results. The application also includes features such
as question banks, timed quizzes, performance analytics, and result dashboards, making it suitable for
both educational and recreational use.
